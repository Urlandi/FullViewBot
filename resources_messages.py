<a href=\"http://data.ris.ripe.net/rrc00/\">rrc00/latest-bview.gz</a> \
raw data file which is managed by the \
<a href=\"https://www.ripe.net/analyse/internet-measurements/routing-information-service-ris\
/routing-information-service-ris\">RIPE NCC RIS project</a> and contains a whole Internet route table dump.\n\n\
Please go to the /settings menu, where you can setup which BGP table statistic v4 or v6 you would like to see. \
The /start command subscribes you to all updates and the /stop unsubscribes and mutes.\n\n\
Updates are every 8 hours at 6, 14, and 22 o'clock MSK timezone. \
The command /status sends the last posted status to the stream.\n\n\
Was inspired by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mellowdrifter\">Darren O'Connor</a> and his Twitter bots. \
My author @UrgentPirate is open for questions and proposals. \
My code is on <a href=\"https://github.com/Urlandi/FullViewBot/issues\">GitHub.</a>"
